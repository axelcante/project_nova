# project_nova
2D Sci-Fi tower-defense game

You can play the game here --> https://ikonico.itch.io/project-nova

You can also download this project and run it in Unity - I used the latest 2020 LTS version to make it.

All the coding bits are in the Assets/Scripts folder (please don't look at MusicPlayer.cs; I know I've been a bad person, but deadlines were looming).

This game was created with the Ludum Dare theme of "10-seconds," which wasn't the best theme ever but it is what it is. This may help you understand some of the design choices!
